# SearchBar Testing Guide

## Fixed Issues
The search bar in the financial dashboard now works properly! Here are the improvements made:

### ‚úÖ What Was Fixed:
1. **Enhanced User Interface**: Improved visual feedback with better styling and animations
2. **Expanded Search Dataset**: Added more stocks (AMZN, META, NFLX, AMD, INTC) to the mock data for better search results
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added proper error states and loading indicators
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Added arrow keys and Enter key support for accessibility
5. **Click Outside to Close**: Dropdown closes when clicking outside the search area
6. **Debug Logging**: Added console logs to help track search functionality

### üîç How to Test the Search Bar:

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test different search queries**:
   - Type "A" ‚Üí Should show Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD
   - Type "Apple" ‚Üí Should show Apple Inc. (AAPL)
   - Type "Microsoft" ‚Üí Should show Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)
   - Type "NVDA" ‚Üí Should show NVIDIA Corporation
   - Type "Netflix" ‚Üí Should show Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)

3. **Test keyboard navigation**:
   - Use ‚Üë/‚Üì arrow keys to navigate results
   - Press Enter to select highlighted result
   - Press Escape to close dropdown

4. **Test selection**:
   - Click on any search result
   - The main dashboard should update to show the selected stock
   - Search bar should clear after selection
